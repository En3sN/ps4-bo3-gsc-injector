# PS4 BO3 GSC Compiler + Injector
This is an open source Black Ops 3 GSC Compiler and Injector for PS4 for the latest 1.33 Update.
It uses a stripped down version of [shiversoftdev/t7-compiler](https://github.com/shiversoftdev/t7-compiler) with all the platform/game/gamemode stuff removed and the opcode database updated.
